      "question": "How is supplier performance measured in the supply chain?",
      "response": "Supplier performance in the supply chain is measured through several key metrics as outlined in the provided context. These metrics are critical for evaluating suppliers and ensuring they meet the business rules established for supplier performance. Here are the primary measures:\n\n1. **On-time Delivery Rate**: This metric assesses the percentage of orders delivered on or before the promised delivery date. The target for on-time delivery is set at greater than 95%. In the SQL query from Source 2, this is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{on\\_time\\_delivery\\_rate} = \\frac{\\text{COUNT(CASE WHEN delivery\\_date <= promised\\_date THEN 1 END)}}{\\text{COUNT(*)}}\n   \\]\n   This indicates how reliably suppliers meet their delivery commitments.\n\n2. **Quality Score**: This metric evaluates the quality of the products supplied by the vendor. The target for the quality score is greater than 98%. The average quality score is computed in the SQL query as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{avg\\_quality\\_score} = \\text{AVG(quality\\_score)}\n   \\]\n   This helps in assessing the overall quality of the products received from suppliers.\n\n3. **Cost Efficiency**: This is measured through budget variance tracking, which involves analyzing the total order value against the budgeted amounts. The SQL query aggregates the total order value with:\n   \\[\n   \\text{total\\_order\\_value} = \\text{SUM(order\\_value)}\n   \\]\n   This metric helps in understanding how well suppliers are performing in terms of cost management.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**: Although not quantified in the SQL query, risk assessment involves evaluating supplier stability metrics. This could include factors such as financial stability, historical performance, and other risk indicators that may affect the supplier's ability to deliver consistently.\n\nThese metrics collectively provide a comprehensive view of supplier performance, enabling the supply chain team to make informed decisions regarding supplier selection, management, and optimization efforts. The data for these metrics is sourced from the `raw.supplier_performance` dataset, as mentioned in Source 3.",

In the SQL query, the average quality score is computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{avg\\_quality\\_score} = \\text{AVG(quality\\_score)}\n   \\]\n   This measure helps in assessing the overall quality of the products received from suppliers.\n\n3. **Cost Efficiency**: This is monitored through budget variance tracking, which involves analyzing the total order value against the budgeted costs. The SQL query aggregates the total order value with:\n   \\[\n   \\text{total\\_order\\_value} = \\text{SUM(order\\_value)}\n   \\]\n   This metric helps in understanding how well suppliers are performing in terms of cost management.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**: Although not explicitly quantified in the SQL query, risk assessment involves evaluating supplier stability metrics. This could include factors such as financial stability, historical performance, and other risk indicators that could affect supply continuity.\n\nThese metrics collectively provide a comprehensive view of supplier performance, enabling the supply chain team to make informed decisions regarding supplier selection, retention, and improvement strategies. The data for these metrics is sourced from the `raw.supplier_performance` dataset, which captures vendor metrics over a specified period (the last 90 days, as indicated in Source 2). \n\nIn summary, supplier performance is measured through on-time delivery rates, quality scores, cost efficiency, and risk assessments, all of which are essential for maintaining a robust and efficient supply chain.",
