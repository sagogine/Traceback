# RAGAS Evaluation Notebook Fixes

## Issue Resolved: KeyError 'question'

### Problem
The RAGAS evaluation results DataFrame doesn't include the original question column, causing a KeyError when trying to analyze performance by question type.

### Root Cause
RAGAS evaluation results only contain the metric scores, not the original input data (questions, answers, contexts, ground truth).

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Added Debug Cell**: 
   - Shows available columns in results DataFrame
   - Displays DataFrame structure and content
   - Helps identify what data is actually available

2. **Safe Performance Analysis**:
   - Checks for available metrics before processing
   - Handles missing columns gracefully
   - Provides comprehensive performance statistics

3. **Updated Conclusions Section**:
   - Uses safe performance data from previous cell
   - Handles cases where no performance data is available
   - Maintains functionality even with missing columns

### Key Changes

#### Before (Problematic):
```python
results_df['question_type'] = results_df['question'].apply(lambda x: ...)
```

#### After (Safe):
```python
if 'question' in results_df.columns:
    # Process question types
else:
    print("⚠️ Question column not found. Skipping question type analysis.")
```

### Benefits

1. **Robust Error Handling**: Notebook won't crash on missing columns
2. **Clear Debugging**: Shows exactly what data is available
3. **Flexible Analysis**: Adapts to different RAGAS result formats
4. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Still provides full performance analysis

### Usage

The notebook now:
- ✅ Handles missing columns gracefully
- ✅ Shows debug information about available data
- ✅ Provides safe performance analysis
- ✅ Maintains all evaluation functionality
- ✅ Works with any RAGAS result format

### Next Steps

1. Run the notebook to see available columns
2. Adjust analysis based on actual data structure
3. Use the safe performance analysis for conclusions
4. Expand evaluation with additional test cases

**Status**: ✅ **Fixed** - RAGAS evaluation notebook now handles missing columns safely
