## Overview
This playbook provides standardized procedures for responding to data pipeline incidents.

## Severity Levels
- **P0**: Critical business impact, revenue loss
- **P1**: High impact, SLA breach risk  
- **P2**: Medium impact, degraded service
- **P3**: Low impact, minor issues

## Response Procedures

### Initial Assessment (0-15 minutes)
1. **Acknowledge** the incident

3. **Determine** blast radius
4. **Notify** stakeholders

### Impact Assessment Questions

### Common Actions

- **Hotfix**: Apply targeted fix
- **Backfill**: Reprocess affected data
- **Skip**: Bypass failed step if non-critical
