# üö® Traceback: Data Pipeline Incident Triage System
**AI-Powered Incident Response with Advanced Retrieval Methods**

---

## üìã Executive Summary

**Traceback** is an intelligent incident triage system that reduces data pipeline incident response time from 30-60 minutes to under 5 minutes by providing instant access to business impact analysis, blast radius assessment, and recommended actions through unified search across documentation, code, and data lineage.

---

## üéØ Task 1: Defining Your Problem and Audience

### Problem Statement (1 sentence)
On-call data engineers can't quickly determine business impact or blast radius during production pipeline incidents because requirements live in fragmented sources (Confluence, Git repos, data catalogs) that aren't built for fast triage.

### Why This Is a Problem for Our Specific Users (1-2 paragraphs)

**For On-Call Data Engineers & Data Platform SREs:**
When a pipeline breaks, engineers spend the first 30-60 minutes chasing answers across multiple disconnected systems. They need to manually correlate information from Confluence docs, Git repositories, and data catalogs to understand "What dashboards went stale?", "Which tables are affected?", and "Who else is impacted?". This fragmented approach leads to inflated MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution), SLA breaches, and risky hotfixes shipped without proper context.

**For Analytics Leads & Product Managers:**
The current state creates cascading delays where business stakeholders receive unclear updates about data trust and availability. This results in paused reports, broken trust in data quality, and delayed business decisions. A focused triaging system that understands docs, code, and lineage can standardize incident communication and provide immediate business impact clarity.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Task 2: Propose a Solution

### Proposed Solution
**Traceback** is an agentic RAG application that unifies three fragmented data sources to power fast, context-rich incident response:

- üìÑ **Requirements docs** (PDF/Markdown specifications)
- üßæ **Pipeline code snippets** (SQL/Python transformations)  
- üß¨ **Column-level lineage graph** (JSON-based dependency mapping)

The system answers natural-language questions like *"Job `curated.sales_orders` failed ‚Äî who's impacted?"* and returns structured incident briefs with impact summaries, blast radius analysis, and recommended actions.

### Technology Stack & Tooling Choices

| Component | Tool | Why This Choice |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **LLM** | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | Low latency with high reasoning capabilities for incident analysis |
| **Embeddings** | text-embedding-3-small | Cost-effective with accurate semantic understanding |
| **Orchestration** | LangGraph | Enables agent loops and intelligent tool routing for complex workflows |
| **Vector Store** | Qdrant | Portable, zero-infrastructure setup with fast similarity search |
| **Web Framework** | FastAPI | High-performance API with automatic OpenAPI documentation |
| **Frontend** | HTML/CSS/JavaScript | Lightweight, responsive interface for rapid prototyping |
| **Monitoring** | LangSmith | Comprehensive logging, tracing, and prompt capture |
| **Evaluation** | RAGAS | Industry-standard metrics for RAG system assessment |

### Agentic Reasoning Implementation

**Where we use agents:**
- **Supervisor Agent**: Interprets user questions and routes to appropriate tools
- **Impact Assessor Agent**: Performs RAG over requirements/runbooks and queries lineage graphs
- **Writer Agent**: Crafts structured incident briefs with citations and recommended actions

**What we use agentic reasoning for:**
- Breaking complex incident questions into subgoals
- Choosing and sequencing appropriate tools (docs search, code analysis, lineage traversal)
- Cross-validating retrieved context from multiple sources
- Determining when sufficient evidence is gathered for a complete response
- Generating structured output with proper citations and action items

## üìä Task 3: Dealing with the Data

### Data Sources and External APIs

**1. Requirements & Runbooks Documentation**
- **Location**: `data/docs/*.pdf|md`
- **Use**: Definitions, SLAs, ownership, incident protocols
- **Examples**: Data Quality Playbook.md, Sales Orders Domain Spec.pdf
- **Why**: Provides authoritative context for what constitutes correct behavior

**2. Pipeline Code & Configurations**
- **Location**: `data/repo/**/*.(sql|py|yaml)`
- **Use**: Table transforms, job owners, PR hints, implementation details
- **Why**: Shows actual implementation and recent changes that might cause incidents

**3. Column Lineage Graph**
- **Location**: `data/lineage.json`
- **Use**: Compute blast radius at table/column level, identify downstream dependencies
- **Format**: Directed graph with nodes (tables/columns) and edges (transformations)
- **Why**: Enables precise impact assessment and dependency mapping

**4. External API Integration**
- **Tavily Search API**: Optional fresh lookups for error messages, root causes, or library changes
- **Use**: Enriches responses with current reference links and external context
- **Why**: Provides up-to-date information beyond static documentation

### Default Chunking Strategy

**Documentation (PDF/Markdown)**
- **Strategy**: Semantic sections of 350-600 tokens with 10-15% overlap
- **Rationale**: Preserves meaning across headings/paragraphs; overlap improves recall for boundary questions

**Code (SQL/Python/YAML)**
- **SQL**: Split by top-level statements (CTE/CREATE/INSERT), cap at 400-700 tokens
- **Python/YAML**: Split by function/class or top-level key blocks, cap at 400-700 tokens
- **Rationale**: Code answers depend on local scope; function/statement boundaries improve precision

**Lineage Data**
- **Strategy**: No vector chunking; kept in memory as JSON and queried via graph traversal
- **Rationale**: Graph relationships require structural querying rather than semantic search

**Why this chunk size?** Smaller chunks increase recall but hurt faithfulness; larger chunks improve context precision but waste tokens. The 350-700 token window provides an optimal balance for RAG over mixed documentation and code.

### Additional Data Requirements

**Optional Enhancement Data:**
- **Incident History**: Previous similar incidents and their resolution patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Historical pipeline performance data for trend analysis
- **Team Contact Information**: On-call rotations and escalation procedures
